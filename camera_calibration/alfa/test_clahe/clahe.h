 * "Contrast Limited Adaptive Histogram Equalization"
 * by Karel Zuiderveld, karel@cv.ruu.nl
 * in "Graphics Gems IV", Academic Press, 1994
 *
 *
 *  These functions implement Contrast Limited Adaptive Histogram Equalization.
 *  The main routine (CLAHE) expects an input image that is stored contiguously in
 *  memory;  the CLAHE output image overwrites the original input image and has the
 *  same minimum and maximum values (which must be provided by the user).
 *  This implementation assumes that the X- and Y image resolutions are an integer
 *  multiple of the X- and Y sizes of the contextual regions. A check on various other
 *  error conditions is performed.
 *
 *  #define the symbol BYTE_IMAGE to make this implementation suitable for
 *  8-bit images. The maximum number of contextual regions can be redefined
 *  by changing uiMAX_REG_X and/or uiMAX_REG_Y; the use of more than 256
 *  contextual regions is not recommended.
 *
 *  The code is ANSI-C and is also C++ compliant.
